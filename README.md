A task to create a template by my teacher at CWA

Create a template (header and nav) with suitable styling for your given e-commerce platform (save this as template.html)
Create a product page, utilising product tiles similar to those seen in the example (remember, you can use the grid or flex attributes for the display property in CSS to help with the alignment(e.g., products-container {display: flex;})
If you finish, add an index.html home page
